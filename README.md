# Vulcain app

The aim of the application was to build an invoice managment system.
I've beed working on vulcain app after my work hours.
I've been concentrating on the front-end app to learn backbone (this was my first backbone app)

I've decided to put this app on the side, cause ... it's not funny :)
I mean i don't get no community behind so no stats and no fun. More over i was alone.

I'm planning to start a new kind of small application that can brings some money with a real community, and will get more
fun out of it!
